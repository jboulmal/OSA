       #   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
       #   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
       #   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
       #   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
       #   approach you can use one of the following variables:
       #   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
       #     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
       #     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
       #     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
       #     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
       #     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
       #   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
       #     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
       #     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
       #     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
       #     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
       #     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
       #     works correctly.
       #   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
       #   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
       #   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
       #   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
       #   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
       #   "force-response-1.0" for this.
